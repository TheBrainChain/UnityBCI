Consider this project just barely stable

# To run:
- Download the SteamVR plugin from the Asset Store
- Load the "Start" scene
- Click 'Traditional', 'SignalGenerator', 'ARSignalProcessing', and 'CursorTask' and then 'Configure'
Will need to download SteamVR plugin from Unity Asset Store (maybe VRTK as well)
Might need to install Leap Motion modules

This will load a simple scene with a cursor moving between two targets via BCI2000


# To do:
- Finish enterprise migration
- Add Leap Motion, Hue, Roku, and TP-Link libraries/scripts
- Cleanup prefabs for 1/2D SMR based tasks
- Create robust minimal viable scene
- Cleanup code (merge conflicts galore from enterprise/local repos)
- DOCUMENTATION!!!
