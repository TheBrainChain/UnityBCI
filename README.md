Consider this project just barely stable

#To run:
- Download the SteamVR plugin from the Asset Store
- Download [BCI2000](https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/BCI2000_Binaries) and place the root BCI2000 folder in the Assets folder
- Load the "Start" scene
- Click 'Traditional', 'SignalGenerator', 'ARSignalProcessing', and 'CursorTask' and then 'Configure'

This will load a simple scene with a cursor moving between two targets via BCI2000


#To do:
- Finish enterprise migration
- Add Leap Motion, Hue, Roku, and TP-Link libraries/scripts
- Cleanup prefabs for 1/2D SMR based tasks
- Create robust minimal viable scene
- Cleanup code (merge conflicts galore from enterprise/local repos)
- DOCUMENTATION!!!
- Release alpha candidate after publication
